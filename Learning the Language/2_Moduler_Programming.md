# Module

Python is a moduler programming language. I can write my own module and post it online to be used by other programmers.

<b>math</b> etc these are built in modules, a simple <b>#import</b> can import these, but in case of <b>pygame</b> or <b>tensorflow</b> we have to install the modules in our system and then only we are able to import
them in our code
